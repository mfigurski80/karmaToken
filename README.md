# LOAN On A Network

The LOAN On A Network Token ($LOAN) is an NFT project aiming to bring more functionality to the NFT space than just images or profiles. Users are able to mint their own NFT, endow it with Loan-like properties, offer standard ether assets as collateral, and sell the resulting stream of ether to functionally take a loan. Users who buy a token will gain access to that stream of ether, making money by loaning out their ether and staying safe because of the collateral system.
