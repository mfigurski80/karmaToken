# LOAN On A Network

The LOAN On A Network Token ($LOAN) is an NFT project aiming to bring more functionality to the NFT space than just images or profiles. Users are able to mint their own NFT, endow it with Loan-like properties, offer standard ether assets as collateral, and sell the resulting stream of ether to functionally take a loan. Users who buy a token will gain access to that stream of ether, making money by loaning out their ether and staying safe because of the collateral system.

These tokens will have a visualization that will be unique based on the following parameters:

* How late in the chain they are (first will be nicer, or maybe it'll be easier to make them nicer because rest of comparison numbers will be smaller)
* How big the total amount is (bigger is cooler)
* How far the due date is (longer is cooler)
* If its active or not (active is cooler, means they will change?)
* Actual due date (some randomness)
